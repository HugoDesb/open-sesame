When working with people with depression and their families or carers: build a trusting relationship and work in an open, engaging and non-judgemental manner.
When working with people with depression and their families or carers: explore treatment options in an atmosphere of hope and optimism, explaining the different courses of depression and that recovery is possible.
When working with people with depression and their families or carers: be aware that stigma and discrimination can be associated with a diagnosis of depression
When working with people with depression and their families or carers: ensure that discussions take place in settings in which confidentiality, privacy and dignity are respected.
When working with people with depression and their families or carers: provide information appropriate to their level of understanding about the nature of depression and the range of treatments available
When working with people with depression and their families or carers: avoid clinical language without adequate explanation
When working with people with depression and their families or carers: ensure that comprehensive written information is available in the appropriate language and in audio format if possible
When working with people with depression and their families or carers: provide and work proficiently with independent interpreters (that is, someone who is not known to the person with depression) if needed.
Inform people with depression about self-help groups, support groups and other local and national resources.
Make all efforts necessary to ensure that a person with depression can give meaningful and informed consent before treatment starts.
This is especially important when a person has severe depression or is subject to the Mental Health Act.
Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: what it comprises
Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: what is expected of the person while having it
Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: likely outcomes (including any side effects).
For people with recurrent severe depression or depression with psychotic symptoms and for those who have been treated under the Mental Health Act, consider developing advance decisions and advance statements collaboratively with the person. 
Record the decisions and statements and include copies in the person's care plan in primary and secondary care.
Give copies to the person and to their family or carer, if the person agrees.
When assessing a person who may have depression, conduct a comprehensive assessment that does not rely simply on a symptom count.
Take into account both the degree of functional impairment and/or disability associated with the possible depression and the duration of the episode.
In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any history of depression and comorbid mental health or physical disorders
In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any past history of mood elevation (to determine if the depression may be part of bipolar disorder)
In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any past experience of, and response to, treatments
In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: the quality of interpersonal relationships
In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: living conditions and social isolation.
When assessing a person with suspected depression, be aware of any learning disabilities or acquired cognitive impairments, and if necessary consider consulting with a relevant specialist when developing treatment plans and strategies.
When providing interventions for people with a learning disability or acquired cognitive impairment who have a diagnosis of depression: where possible, provide the same interventions as for other people with depression
When providing interventions for people with a learning disability or acquired cognitive impairment who have a diagnosis of depression: if necessary, adjust the method of delivery or duration of the intervention to take account of the disability or impairment.
When depression is accompanied by symptoms of anxiety, the first priority should usually be to treat the depression.
When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).
Offer people with depression advice on sleep hygiene if needed, including: establishing regular sleep and wake times
Offer people with depression advice on sleep hygiene if needed, including: avoiding excess eating, smoking or drinking alcohol before sleep
Offer people with depression advice on sleep hygiene if needed, including: creating a proper environment for sleep
Offer people with depression advice on sleep hygiene if needed, including: taking regular physical exercise.
For people who, in the judgement of the practitioner, may recover with no formal intervention, or people with mild depression who do not want an intervention, or people with subthreshold depressive symptoms who request an intervention: discuss the presenting problem(s) and any concerns that the person may have about them
For people who, in the judgement of the practitioner, may recover with no formal intervention, or people with mild depression who do not want an intervention, or people with subthreshold depressive symptoms who request an intervention: provide information about the nature and course of depression
For people who, in the judgement of the practitioner, may recover with no formal intervention, or people with mild depression who do not want an intervention, or people with subthreshold depressive symptoms who request an intervention: arrange a further assessment, normally within 2 weeks
For people who, in the judgement of the practitioner, may recover with no formal intervention, or people with mild depression who do not want an intervention, or people with subthreshold depressive symptoms who request an intervention: make contact if the person does not attend follow-up appointments.
For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy
For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: computerised cognitive behavioural therapy
For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: a structured group physical activity programme.
Group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressivesymptoms or mild to moderate depression should: be based on a structured model such as 'Coping with Depression'
Group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressivesymptoms or mild to moderate depression should: be delivered by two trained and competent practitioners
Group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressivesymptoms or mild to moderate depression should: consist of 10 to 12 meetings of eight to ten participants
Group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressivesymptoms or mild to moderate depression should: normally take place over 12 to 16 weeks, including follow-up.
Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression
Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with:initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years)
Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression that persist(s) after other interventions.
For people with moderate or severe depression, provide a combination of antidepressant medication and a high-intensity psychological intervention (CBT or IPT).
The choice of intervention should be influenced by the duration of the episode of depression and the trajectory of symptoms 
The choice of intervention should be influenced by the previous course of depression and response to treatment 
The choice of intervention should be influenced by the likelihood of adherence to treatment and any potential adverse effects 
The choice of intervention should be influenced by the person's treatment preference and priorities.
When an antidepressant is to be prescribed, it should normally be an SSRI in a generic form because SSRIs are equally effective as other antidepressants and have a favourable risk–benefit ratio. 
Also take the following into account: SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of bleeding, especially in older people or in people taking other drugs that have the potential to damage the gastrointestinal mucosa or interfere with clotting. 
In particular, consider prescribing a gastroprotective drug in older people who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.
Also take the following into account Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine are associated with a higher propensity for drug interactions than other SSRIs
Also take the following into account Paroxetine is associated with a higher incidence of discontinuation symptoms than other SSRIs.
Do not routinely vary the treatment strategies for depression described in this guideline either by depression subtype (for example, atypical depression or seasonal depression) or by personal characteristics (for example, sex or ethnicity) as there is no convincing evidence to support such action.
Advise people with winter depression that follows a seasonal pattern and who wish to try light therapy in preference to antidepressant or psychological treatment that the evidence for the efficacy of light therapy is uncertain.
When prescribing antidepressants for older people: prescribe at an age-appropriate dose taking into account the effect of general physical health and concomitant medication on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
When prescribing antidepressants for older people: carefully monitor for side effects.
For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months
For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.
Medication management as a separate intervention for people with depression should not be provided routinely by services. It is likely to be effective only when provided as part of a more complex intervention.
For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: referring to specialist mental health services for a programme of coordinated multiprofessional care
For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: providing collaborative care if the depression is in the context of a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment
When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: check adherence to, and side effects from, initial treatment
When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: increase the frequency of appointments using outcome monitoring with a validated outcome measure
When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: be aware that using a single antidepressant rather than combination medication or augmentation (see recommendations 1.8.1.5 to 1.8.1.9) is usually associated with a lower side-effect burden
When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to, including increasing the dose
When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: consider switching to an alternative antidepressant.
When switching to another antidepressant, be aware that the evidence for the relative advantage of switching either within or between classes is weak.
Consider switching to: initially a different SSRI or a better tolerated newer-generation antidepressant subsequently an antidepressant of a different pharmacological class that may be less well tolerated, for example venlafaxine, a TCA or an MAOI.
Do not switch to, or start, dosulepin because evidence supporting its tolerability relative to other antidepressants is outweighed by the increased cardiac risk and toxicity in overdose.
When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): select medications that are known to be safe when used together
When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): be aware of the increased side-effect burden this usually causes
When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): discuss the rationale for any combination with the person with depression, follow GMC guidance if off-label medication is prescribed, and monitor carefully for adverse effects
When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): be familiar with primary evidence and consider obtaining a second opinion when using unusual combinations, the evidence for the efficacy of a chosen strategy is limited or the risk–benefit ratio is unclear
When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): document the rationale for the chosen combination.
When prescribing lithium:monitor renal and thyroid function before treatment and every 6 months duringtreatment (more often if there is evidence of renal impairment)
When prescribing lithium: consider ECG monitoring in people with depression who are at high risk ofcardiovascular disease
When prescribing lithium:monitor serum lithium levels 1 week after initiation and each dose change until stable, and every 3 months thereafter.
